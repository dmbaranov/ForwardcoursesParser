# ForwardcoursesParser

Simple parser for forwardcourses.com 
To use it you must install selenium: ``pip3 install selenium``
After that create a text file ``links.txt`` and on each line insert a link to the workshop, e.g. https://forwardcourses.com/workshops/64
To launch script, in terminal run ``python main.py``. Script was tested on Linux with python 3.5
After that type your login and password and just wait. If login or password was incorrect, simply relaunch this script.

Have fun :)
